# sorl1_4way_RNASeq_6m
Analysis of a zebrafish model of an early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOfAD) mutation in *sortilin-related receptor 1* (*sorl1*). Analysis was performed on a tank of heterozygous EOfAD-like mutants, heterozygous null mutants, mutants trans-heterozgous for the the EOfAD-like mutation and the null mutation, and their wild-type siblings in a 'four-way' analysis. Analysing siblings raised in the same tank reduces environmental and genetic variation, which improves our chances of seeing subtle effects due to *sorl1* genotype.
