# sorl1_4way_RNASeq_6m
Analysis of a zebrafish model of an early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease mutation in sortilin-related receptor 1. Analysis was performed on a tank of heterozygous EOfAD-like mutants, heterozygous null mutants, mutants trans-heterozgous for the the EOfAD-like mutation and the null mutation, and their wild-type siblings at 6 months of age.
